    <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h2>
    <p>· Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.</p>
    <p>· Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat — after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.</p>
    <p>· Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</p>
